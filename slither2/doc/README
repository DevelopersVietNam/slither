This is the Slither 2.0 release.

Before you can do anything with Slither, you must edit all of the files
having a .in suffix for your configuration. 

In all likelihood, a script will be provided in the future. But it must be 
done by hand at present.

Also, please note that the "wpl" libraries are now included in the Slither
directory proper.
