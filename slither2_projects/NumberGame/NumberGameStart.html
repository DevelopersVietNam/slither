<b>Welcome!</b>
<p>
This is the NumberGame. The object of the game is to guess the
correct number. The application will randomly select a number between
a fixed range. It will track your progress with each guess.
</p>
<p>
The point behind this game is to demonstrate how easy it is to write
web applcaitions that are stateful with Slither. The NumberGame has two logical
states: guessing a number and guessing the correct answer. We highly
suggest downloading the code and looking through it.
